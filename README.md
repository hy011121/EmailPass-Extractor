## WTF is This?

You got a text file lookin’ like it went through a hurricane? This thing takes out the junk, spits out the clean stuff. No “country” this, no “provider” that, just straight `email:password`. You’re welcome.

2. **Run the Script** - Fire up PowerShell and run this bad boy.
3. **Check Your Output** - The clean stuff’ll be waiting for you in `outputFile.txt`. Boom.

### Instructions for the N00bs

   .\your_script_name.ps1
   ```
3. Let it work. You’ll get the file when it’s done.
